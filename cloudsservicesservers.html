  <br>What does it do?
  <br>Cloud computing is the use of remote computers to store, manage and process data via the internet rather than on a local server.
  Cloud computing has the potential to take on many of the day-to-day tasks that both business and the individual
  use within the IT environment, from simple remote storage to complete operating systems. The ongoing development and
  migration to cloud based services can be seen everywhere in the modern IT environment. For example, the evolution of software
  acquisition from purchasing a copy on a disc from a store to purchasing and downloading it from a server or using it directly within a browser.
  <br>
  <br>The evolution of cloud computing:
  <br>During the early 1960’s, Professor John McCarthy suggested computing would be sold as a utility.
  Through the 70’s and 80’s research into virtualisation, operating systems and networking advanced,
  allowing the first financial institutes to make wire transfers<a href="#r1">[1]</a>. Although networks had been around for many years,
  the first of  January 1983 is considered to be the official birthday of the internet as TCP/IP was introduced<a href="#r2">[2]</a>,
  developing into the World Wide Web though the 1990’s. The modern-day cloud was realised by Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  launching its public cloud in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>COVID and the Cloud:
  <br>The outbreak of COVID-19 18 months ago, pushed many businesses to reconsider their business
  models and move the work environment to a home situation.  This move placed significant additional workload
  onto cloud services such as Microsoft teams, Zoom & Skype as these services allowed for connectivity of workers.
  The increase in user and server requirements, necessitated the providers to spend a significant amount of money upgrading
  their operations which indirectly contributed to the   current worldwide chip shortage.
  <br>
  <br>The Cutting Edge:
  <br>Cloud computing allows data analytics to be performed on a large scale, this can assist industries like Healthcare where,
  data can be used to predict negative health outcomes, thus prompting a model of care changes in the Emergency Department and reducing hospitalisations<a href="#r3">[3]</a>.
  Another use of data analytics has been to prevent computer hacking, in this field it is sometimes called security analytics,
  but the same trend applied. Analyse the data and use it to find new ways to detect, protect and deal with threats.
  Of course, analytics also has the potential to be used in negative ways as demonstrated in the “Cambridge Analytica” where
  information was farmed for political gain.
  AI as it is called, is a program that can sift through an enormous amount of information in a reasonably shorty time,
  then come up with insights or actions that are far more in-depth that what a human could achieve, this is fantastic to help
  organisations to look at and solve problems in a unique way<a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
  <br>
  <br>The Future cloud:
  <br>Multi cloud is a strategy trending throughout the business world, this is a term used to
  describe the use of multiple cloud providers to meet various service requirements.
  Another alternative is hybrid cloud which refers to a combination of private (on or offsite) & public facilities that combine resources.
  Over the next 2 to 3 years, we are expected to see even more businesses migrate their IT operation
  to the cloud. The obvious benefits being flexibility of growth and services, combined with the
  pay as you go structure allowing all users to use the cloud for the exact purpose they desire.
  <br>
  <br>Positive & Negative Impact:
  <br>Reduced cost: cloud computing is structured around paying for what you need, this allows a
  business to start small and increase the resources at their disposal when required. Additionally,
  there is no upfront cost for infrastructure setup or maintenance unlike onsite infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>Flexibility & Scalability:cloud customers have the flexibility to use one or multiple cloud services or even
  providers to attain their goals, the customer can offload all or a minimal amount of the workload depending on requirements.
  Alongside this, the customer can scale up or down there requirements instantaneously.
  <br>
  <br>Accessibility: Having everything online, means that the business can access their information from practically anywhere at any time.
  Work is no longer confined to time or physical locations.  In addition, communicating and collaborating on
  projects becomes much easier as everyone who needs to can access the same space or documents<a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
  <br>
  <br>Employment: Employees that look after onsite infrastructure may no longer have work when a business moves to the
  cloud, with that said within Capital One’s move to the cloud they reported an increase in software and technical
  associates from 4,500 to 11,000 over 8 years<a href="#r6">[6]</a>.
  <br>It is a highly likely hypothesis the vast majority of business will migrate to the cloud in the near future, the
  positive arguments seem to heavily outweigh the negative. Success stories like Capital One make it hard to ignore the benefits.
  <br>
  <br>The personal effects of the cloud:
  Until recently, I have had little to do with cloud-based operations with the exception of
  social media sites like Facebook and Instagram. I cannot simply bypass them however as I use them
  regularly to communicate with family and friends overseas. Facebook and its associated messenger have been my main
  communication line for many years. And thanks to Facetime, last year I was able to attend my grandfather’s funeral in
  real time 20,000kms away, something that 10 years ago would have been an impossibility.
  <br>
  <br>Working though this course has changed my perspective on using the cloud, it has raised
  my awareness of the benefits of using different services. I have engaged with Google Photos, Zoom Microsoft Teams
  and OneDrive and I am looking into server space to back-up my own infrastructure.
  The doorway is not only open for business but very much for the individual. It is becoming obvious
  to me that my understanding of IT in regards to cloud services and how the cloud interacts with other
  applications is nowhere near as educated as I believed.
  <br>
  <br>Use of a cloud is a daily event for the majority of my family, although most probably do not
  know it. We use email servers, social media, media streaming, food ordering apps, Healthcare,
  banking and much more without a thought into where the information comes from or moves to.
  <br>
  <br>As business and individuals all move toward the cloud, it is hard to see what it will become, at present
  the only limitation seems to be the speed in which we can access this data via the internet, remove this
  limitation and we may no longer need home computers at all.
