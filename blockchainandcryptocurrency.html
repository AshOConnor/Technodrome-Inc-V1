            <h3>What does it blockchain and cryptocurrency do?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency was first created back in 2009 by an unknown group of developers or a single developer who call themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. The first cryptocurrency to be created was “Bitcoin” and was created by the Satoshi Nakamoto group. In the year of 2014 blockchain 2.0 technology was created to support different formats of use instead of just cryptocurrency,
              it was developed even further to support multiple different programming designs to which came the  creation of smart contracts (History of blockchain, 2021).
              <br>Blockchain is a unique type of database, it is an open decentralized ledger that collects information and stores it and is quite different to a generic database. A generic database stores its information or data in tables whereas a Blockchain database stores its information or data together in a block which is chained together (Conway, 2021). When a block is created it gets an exact timestamp of when the data is implied and then it is added to the chain. Bitcoin cryptocurrency is a type of blockchain made up from data blocks created from a database. This database cannot be altered, faked or hacked (Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, 2021).

            <h3>What is the likely impact of blockchain and cryptocurrency?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency could have a huge impact on the current and future world.
              Today’s climate change could be reversed using hybrid smart contracts. Hybrid smart contracts are software programs that use blockchains to interact with real world data. This can be achieved by using satellite images. Communities and businesses can get involved by planting new trees or vegetation on their land to help the carbon footprint, provided they are involved in a certified program.
              The satellite then takes an image of the location the tree has been planted and reports it back through the blockchain. Once the data has been taken from the blockchain and put into the smart contract then the rewards are given out via the program (Chainlink, 2021). Therefore, blockchain can have a huge impact on the global climate.

            <p>Cryptocurrency has started an entirely new job industry; this involves cryptocurrency exchange supervising and exchange maintenance. The cryptocurrency advancement has changed a lot of things since the rise of Bitcoin. The impact it is having on larger corporations due to fast and low-cost transactions have caused a heavy hit to the big players, but do we really think that the banks should control our money all the time?
               Cryptocurrency transactions eliminates the need for a middleman by working on a 1 to 1 basis, letting you directly receive and send crypto to another user, letting the user have ultimate control on their currency. Then there are investments in the crypto world, where most investors are turning away from generic investments and investing more and more in cryptocurrencies. Investors are starting to increase their portfolios by 3-4% with cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (Ullah, 2021). This shows how much cryptocurrency is already having an impact on larger corporations whether it be by losing everyday customers or losing investors.
