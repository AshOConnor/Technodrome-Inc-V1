                Having moved around Australia alot as a youngster, right through to his late 20's, Brendan now finds himself settled down in SEQ with absolutely no desire to pack a moving box again...ever. A keen amature participant in local triathlons, Brendan regularly sets off on his bike with a few friends on the weekend, exploring and searching the outer and hinterland areas of SEQ for the best hidden cafe, because coffee is life. His interest in I.T began through using his first family computer many years ago. The curiosity flood gates were properly opened once he got to see the inside of a computer and see all the different parts and how they connected and interacted with each other. This curiosity, over the years, has lead him to build, maintain, overclock and fault find his own computers, and he has now started dabbling in home networking and IoT devices. As his I.T hobby has now transitioned into a career choice, Brendan is now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT to learn and develop more skills for a career within the I.T industry.

                Mark Berry is an English native whose sense of adventure coupled with a desire to continuously challenge himself
                has seen him move over 15,000 kilometers from his birthplace in Avening, England to Australia.  In his early days in
                Australia, Mark felt the pangs of homesickness but was determined to experience everything that Australia offered and to
                become intwined in the Australian culture and Australian past times.  His training and experience as a fine dining chef
                allowed him to spend many months exploring areas of Australia in either his 4-wheel drive or on a motorbike whilst working.
                Marks interest in IT started during his school years, with exposure to early IBM computers and a teacher whose enthusiasm and passion for
                IT was infectious. Being a practically minded person, Mark has a need to understand the how and why things work
                which has seen him spend countless hours learning about computer hardware and software.  Family and friends have
                benefited from Mark’s knowledge and skills in computer upgrades and software issues. In the last 18 months, Mark has started a
                small business which he offers a repair type service to the local community at a low price and in times of COVID his work has been for free.
                Whilst Mark will always love cooking, his true passion is for IT and now with life experience he is finally following that passion with Technodrome Inc.

      <br>
      Within Technodrome inc., 3 of our members would like to be in a developer type role. Developer roles are creative positions that build and create software and applications. Engineer roles where chosen by 2 members and are similar in that they are a creative position, but apply different principles to their work. An engineer will be responsible for designing, building and maintaining software and services, while a developer is working to improve and develop existing software. An architect, chosen by Edwin, Is another similar role as is also a very creative heavy role. An architect may not be responsible for the labour of coding specific applications or features like a developer may be, but will have included them on the design for a project.
      <Br>
      <br>
      A very clear management structure can be seen within Technodrome inc. starting at the top will be the project architect, Edwin who will design a project blueprint. The engineers such as Kim and Brendan will design sections of the blueprint and plans for them, and the development team, Chris, Mark and Ash will work actively on creating said plans and designs through programming.
      <br>
      <br>
      A lot of the roles share similar duties and common skillsets, as can be seen in our section <a href="https://kimlamwalls.github.io/Group30/industrydata.html" industry data>Industry Data</a> (link).
