                Having moved around Australia alot as a youngster, right through to his late 20's, Brendan now finds himself settled down in SEQ with absolutely no desire to pack a moving box again...ever. A keen amature participant in local triathlons, Brendan regularly sets off on his bike with a few friends on the weekend, exploring and searching the outer and hinterland areas of SEQ for the best hidden cafe, because coffee is life. His interest in I.T began through using his first family computer many years ago. The curiosity flood gates were properly opened once he got to see the inside of a computer and see all the different parts and how they connected and interacted with each other. This curiosity, over the years, has lead him to build, maintain, overclock and fault find his own computers, and he has now started dabbling in home networking and IoT devices. As his I.T hobby has now transitioned into a career choice, Brendan is now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT to learn and develop more skills for a career within the I.T industry.
