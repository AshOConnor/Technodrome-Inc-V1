            <h1>
              Yes Chef!
            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>
              <strong>Overview:</strong>
              <br>Yes Chef is a hospitality application currently under development by Technodrome Inc.
              Yes Chef’s primary goal is to consolidate all aspects of kitchen administration, allowing a chef or
              manager to easily monitor and control the business component
              (food costing, recipes, daily invoicing and wage control).
              The app will take information from the user in the form of goods,
              operating percentages, profits & expenses to allow a day-to-day
              feedback on where the business sits both financially and stock wise.
              The application will also delve into rostering, ordering.
              <br>
              <br>Our team is determined to design and build an application that
              is easy to use, intuitive and provides up to date and
              relevant information for the user.
              <br>Yes Chef! will be the go-to application for the Hospitality industry.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
              <strong>Motivation:</strong>
              <br>As of June 2016, there were a little over 85,000 eating out establishments in Australia with only 34% of these belonging to the Fast food industry <a href="#f1">[1]</a>,
              yet there is a complete lack of an application that tackles the behind the scenes of kitchen operation. In researching this I have found that the applications
              available are usually “recipe” apps or “measurement converters”.<a href="#f2">[2]</a>   Mark Berry one of our team members has encountered these
              challenges in his previous roles in the hospitality industry and has had to created workarounds by using spreadsheets.
              In addition, we questioned chefs from all over the world to ask them what they would expect from our app.<a href="#f3">[3]</a>
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
              <strong>Description:</strong>
              <br>
              <br>Welcome Page:
              <br>This is the landing page which will contain login option, notifications and links to all areas within the app.
              The application will allow the user to continue and use the application without an account,
              however the user’s information will then only be available on the device in use and will be lost if the
              application is deleted, this is to encourage account creation without demanding it.<a href="#f4">[4]</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              <br>Dish Costing:
              <br>A page that will let the chef add ingredients, ingredients cost, & the percentage that the business
              expects to make from food sales. This will then output the sale price for the chef and create printable clean
              recipe cards for the rest of the team to follow. Once the dish has been prepared for the first time it can be
              photographed for reference on the recipe card, this will help consistency with the finished dish.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              <br>Below are early concepts for Recipe costing & Recipe cards.
              <br>

              <img src="img\concept_recipe_card.PNG" alt="" class="img-dish_concept">
              <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              <br>Invoice Tracking:
              <br>This section of the application will have drop down menus for each supplier, item &
              amount as well as a search bar for quick referencing. The application will store every item
              that the kitchen buys much like a spreadsheet, these “lists” can be added to during invoice entry, dish costing or
              from a shopping list. Potential we can work with suppliers to have application program interfaces for each supplier to
              directly submit invoice information and pricing to save the user time.
            <br>
            <br>
              <br>
              <br>Cost Monitoring by the item:
              <br>In this part of the application, the user can view every purchased item throughout a selected period, price increases or
              decreases will be highlighted, this will assist the user in monitoring supplier price fluctuations and mistakes.<a href="#f5">[5]</a>
              <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              <br>Ordering:
              <br>In the ordering area of the application, the user can create an order list “shopping list”.
              Each item can be designated to a preferred supplier, the user can refer to the list for a phone order
              or attach it to an email. With API interaction it could be possible to send an order directly to a suppliers
              ordering system. The option needs to be open as different users prefer different methods of placing the order.
            <br>
              <br>
            <br>
              <br>Rostering:
              <br>Rostering will let the chef create and cost a working roster it will have drag and drop features as
              shifts in the industry change regularly. The roster will also be able to be sent directly to all team members.
              The costing information created by the roster will be information included in the daily overview to allow wages to be taken into account.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              <br>The recipe book:
              <br>In the recipe book a user will be able to create and store recipes to use both online & on device.
              The user will have the option to share these recipes or not, if a recipe is shared it can be viewed by
              any user of the application by searching. When importing a recipe, items can be added to the shopping list and
              organized to a local supplier for this ingredient.<a href="#f6">[6]</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              <br>Overview:
              <br>The overview is the main place to review what is happening, a daily, weekly, monthly & yearly running cost and
              expenditure. the user will be able to see wages, food cost and revenue all together and break down each item as they
              need to see it. This will be a simple and clean place for review, it needs to be user friendly for
              those who are not mathematically inclined.

            <p>
              <strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong>
              <br>There are a couple of things that we need to be able to define when creating Yes Chef.
                  We need to have a front end and a back end development team or simply just full-stack developers. The front end development team will look after the layout, navigation, graphics, user interaction, animation and data processing.
                  The front end team will help build this application by using the following essential front end development tools:
            <br>
            <br>
                    1. React and React Native. This front end development tool is the most used tool for building app interfaces and websites. React contains a Javascript library with pre-built applications making it easier to debug when needed.
                <br>2. MaterialUI. MaterialUI is a UI framework and is essential for front end development. It is one of the most commonly used when creating apps. It allows sections of the UI to be highly customisable and helps to reduce the code written to make it denser. It also reduces the time spent while creating the project.
                <br>3. Chrome Dev Tools. Chrome development tools help with testing the application that is developed. It allows us to preview the work that has been done with multiple options to view it from different devices such as an iPhone 6 or a Galaxy S5. This tool also allows us to view network activity and to show the developers if the resources are working as expected. It also has a built-in audit performance reviewer helping the developer to understand how the performance and accessibility of the application is.
                <br>4. Sass. Sass is a CSS front end developer tool that allows the creation of large code to become more concise when developed for ease of change when later in the development or update stages.
                <br>5. VSCode. VSCode helps with the production of source code. VSCode also has a Git function that allows you to pull branches, stage changes and commit.
                <br>(Sousa, 2021)
                <br>
                <br>
                   The back end development team takes care of the server-side things and all things that are communicating between the browser and the database.
                   There will be requirements from the back end developers in the development of Yes Chef and the tools used to help create it as follows:
                <br>
                <br>
                   1. Database. The developer will need to create a large database to handle all information that is stored from clients and users. We as a team will need to decide on which database we would like to go with as there are multiple different ones.
                <br>2. Scripting languages. The back end developers will need to have extremely high scripting language experience preferably in either C# or Java as they are the most advantageous when coding on the server-side. These two languages are usually interlinked with other languages like Python and Ruby.
                <br>3. Web Development Architectures. This is a much have as it helps design the app to have the most suitable system before software development begins.

                <br>
                <p><strong> Skills required: </strong></p>
                <p>•	Programming Languages:
                <br>Increasing our knowledge in using different types of programming languages is a required skill,
                as there are many operating systems that our users will be using. It is important to be able to create
                a product that all our users can use no matter the device or operating system they are already using.
                <br>•	Creativity and Problem solving:
                <br>Both these skills are highly important to have when trying to create anything,
                trying to solve a problem or meeting the needs of our users will come with obstacles.
                These skills will help us both overcome these obstacles but, also create more then one way to do so
                and from this expanding, improving and finding the most efficient way to develop our product.
                <br>•	Communication:
                <br>This is a key skill to have not just with our desired audience but also to
                have in our development team. It is through communication that we can ask the
                required questions to gather the required data to be able to complete the desired final product.
                Also, through affective communication the entire team can work efficiently through all stages of the development.
                <br>•	Analytical Skills:
                <br>It is very important to be able to analyse and understand the needs of the
                users for the application we are trying to create. Also, it is important to analyse
                and keep into consideration the way they will be using the application for these needs. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                <strong>Outcome:</strong>
                <br>Upon successful release of the application, Technodrome INC would have a fully functional Hospitality
                application that can serve not only Chefs and kitchen staff but the hospitality industry. The application which targets the
                Hospitality industry will be a result of our passion for bringing simplicity to the necessary but sometimes complex task of administration. Our goal is to assist business while making the users workload more manageable.
                Welcome Yes Chef!

              <br>Matthew Puncher, former chef, Calcot Manor, Gloucestershire, England.
              <br>It would need to track staff times so the ability to enter hours worked, food cost it would need to have the ability to put in stock received and then track stock usage, possibly a barcode scanner for products and the ability to enter weights and measures. Other tracking is a bit more complicated as breaking down electricity and gas etc is more of an overall running cost than a kitchen specific cost.

              <br>We use ctb at work, one of the things I have noticed is when a supplier changes their prices on items they don't actually
              notify you which can lead to massive variances, we spend about 15 to 20 grand a week on stock so you can imagine how much money we make on
              food a week, when I do our weekly stock take I notice certain variances.
