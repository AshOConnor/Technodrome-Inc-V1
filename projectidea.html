            <h2>
              Yes Chef!
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p class="profile">
              Overview:
              <br>Yes Chef is a hospitality application currently under development by Technodrome Inc.
              Yes Chef’s primary goal is to consolidate all aspects of kitchen administration, allowing a chef or
              manager to easily monitor and control the business component
              (food costing, recipes, daily invoicing and wage control).
              The app will take information from the user in the form of goods,
              operating percentages, profits & expenses to allow a day-to-day
              feedback on where the business sits both financially and stock wise.
              The application will also delve into rostering, ordering.
              <br>
              <br>Our team is determined to design and build an application that
              is easy to use, intuitive and provides up to date and
              relevant information for the user.
              <br>Yes Chef! will be the go-to application for the Hospitality industry.
            <p>
              <br>Motivation:
              <br>As of June 2016, there were a little over 85,000 eating out establishments in Australia with only 34% of these belonging to the Fast food industry <a href="#f1">[1]</a>,
              yet there is a complete lack of an application that tackles the behind the scenes of kitchen operation. In researching this I have found that the applications
              available are usually “recipe” apps or “measurement converters”.<a href="#f2">[2]</a>   Mark Berry one of our team members has encountered these
              challenges in his previous roles in the hospitality industry and has had to created workarounds by using spreadsheets.
              In addition, we questioned chefs from all over the world to ask them what they would expect from our app.<a href="#f3">[3]</a>
              <p>
                <br>Description:
                <br>
                <br>Welcome Page:
                <br>This is the landing page which will contain login option, notifications and links to all areas within the app.
                The application will allow the user to continue and use the application without an account,
                however the user’s information will then only be available on the device in use and will be lost if the
                application is deleted, this is to encourage account creation without demanding it.<a href="#f4">[4]</a>
                <br>
                <br>Dish Costing:
                <br>A page that will let the chef add ingredients, ingredients cost, & the percentage that the business
                expects to make from food sales. This will then output the sale price for the chef and create printable clean
                recipe cards for the rest of the team to follow. Once the dish has been prepared for the first time it can be
                photographed for reference on the recipe card, this will help consistency with the finished dish.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Below are early concepts for Recipe costing & Recipe cards.

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Invoice Tracking:
                <br>This section of the application will have drop down menus for each supplier, item &
                amount as well as a search bar for quick referencing. The application will store every item
                that the kitchen buys much like a spreadsheet, these “lists” can be added to during invoice entry, dish costing or
                from a shopping list. Potential we can work with suppliers to have application program interfaces for each supplier to
                directly submit invoice information and pricing to save the user time.
                <br>
                <br>Cost Monitoring by the item:
                <br>In this part of the application, the user can view every purchased item throughout a selected period, price increases or
                decreases will be highlighted, this will assist the user in monitoring supplier price fluctuations and mistakes.<a href="#f5">[5]</a>
                <br>
                <br>Ordering:
                <br>In the ordering area of the application, the user can create an order list “shopping list”.
                Each item can be designated to a preferred supplier, the user can refer to the list for a phone order
                or attach it to an email. With API interaction it could be possible to send an order directly to a suppliers
                ordering system. The option needs to be open as different users prefer different methods of placing the order.
                <br>
                <br>Rostering:
                <br>Rostering will let the chef create and cost a working roster it will have drag and drop features as
                shifts in the industry change regularly. The roster will also be able to be sent directly to all team members.
                The costing information created by the roster will be information included in the daily overview to allow wages to be taken into account.
                <br>
                <br>The recipe book:
                <br>In the recipe book a user will be able to create and store recipes to use both online & on device.
                The user will have the option to share these recipes or not, if a recipe is shared it can be viewed by
                any user of the application by searching. When importing a recipe, items can be added to the shopping list and
                organized to a local supplier for this ingredient.<a href="#f6">[6]</a>
                <br>
                <br>Overview:
                <br>The overview is the main place to review what is happening, a daily, weekly, monthly & yearly running cost and
                expenditure. the user will be able to see wages, food cost and revenue all together and break down each item as they
                need to see it. This will be a simple and clean place for review, it needs to be user friendly for
                those who are not mathematically inclined.

              <br>Matthew Puncher, former chef, Calcot Manor, Gloucestershire, England.
              <br>It would need to track staff times so the ability to enter hours worked, food cost it would need to have the ability to put in stock received and then track stock usage, possibly a barcode scanner for products and the ability to enter weights and measures. Other tracking is a bit more complicated as breaking down electricity and gas etc is more of an overall running cost than a kitchen specific cost.

              <br>We use ctb at work, one of the things I have noticed is when a supplier changes their prices on items they don't actually
              notify you which can lead to massive variances, we spend about 15 to 20 grand a week on stock so you can imagine how much money we make on
              food a week, when I do our weekly stock take I notice certain variances.
