            <h3>What is an Autonomous Vehicle? </h3>

            <br>

            <p> An Autonomous Vehicle is a vehicle that is constantly collecting data from its surroundings through various sensors and cameras and using that data it can operate and without the input of a human driver (Gartner, 2021). Autonomous systems have become a rapidly growing part of the automotive industry with a vast majority of vehicle manufacturers working to better include them and to create more sophisticated autonomous features in their products. Back in the year of 2016 a Swedish Car manufacturing company called Volvo made a shocking pledge, Volvo said “That by the year 2020, no one will be killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo car or SUV.” This statement is not an easy promised to keep but Volvo has heavily focused to make their vehicles more autonomous and safer with each passing year. Vehicles have always been driven by us, people, humans, but what that means is that there is always going to be room for human error. What Autonomous systems are trying to do is reduce the room for human error and fill that gap with technology that can see, react and predict better then what we can order to create a much safer driving experience for everyone on the roads. As so many systems have become autonomous over the past few years so too is the Automotive industry heading the same direction. Autonomous Vehicles what does this mean? The best way to describe an Autonomous Vehicle is a car that can self-propel itself by using information gathered by a range of in-vehicle technologies such as drive by wire systems, radars, various sensors and GPS positioning technology.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p><strong> Current most common Autonomous features found in various car brands today: </strong></p>
            <p> <strong> Adaptive Cruise Control </strong> </p>
            <p> This feature when activated monitors the surroundings of the vehicle through various inputs such as sensors and even GPS positioning. With all this gathered information the vehicle can automatically accelerate and apply the brakes according to the upcoming traffic and road conditions. The vehicle with completely stop when required and accelerate to reach the desired set speed of travel that the user has set, all this is done automatically and can be overridden by the driver at any time (Kobylinski, 2019) </p>

            <br>

            <p><strong> Park Assist Pilot </strong></p>
            <p> This feature when activated helps the driver to park in difficult spaces or just in general make the process of parking your vehicle much easier. This system relies on various parking sensors and cameras fitted around the front, rear and sides of the vehicle to determine the way to park the vehicle in the desire parking location. This system can be considered only half autonomous as the braking and accelerating of the vehicle is control by the driver, only the turning of the steering system is automatically control by the vehicles computer (Buyacar, 2021). </p>

            <br>

            <p><strong> Driver Emergency Stop Assist </strong></p>
            <p> In the unfortunate event that the driver of a vehicle fitted with this feature is not paying close attention to the vehicles surroundings and comes too close to another vehicle, person or object the vehicle will automatically apply the brakes in full force to completely stop all movement of the vehicle. This is done by gathering information from the parking sensors and blind spot monitoring sensors.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong> Lane Assist Systems </strong></p>
            <p> This System when activated monitors the positioning of the vehicle in the lane that it is traveling in and if the vehicle begins to drift outside of the current lane without indicating the vehicle warns the driver and, in some cases, depending on the manufacturer it can also automatically correct itself to stay within the lane. This achieved by a forward-facing camera built into the rear-view mirror that is constantly scanning the road and reading the lane markings. This system is designed to prevent collisions in the event the driver dozes off or is too fatigued to correctly control the vehicle while driving (Nowak, 2018).  </p>

            <br>

            <p> In the not-too-distant future, we are very likely to see vehicles becoming more automized. Volvo is currently pushing to making their vehicles have a self-driving feature in the next upcoming years. This new feature by Volvo is called “Highway Pilot” and will make the vehicle capable of driving itself on highway roads without the need of the driver monitoring the road or vehicle. This will be possible by gathering continuous information with an array of sensors fitted across the whole vehicle as well as a Lidar System from Luminar that will be monitoring surroundings. It is estimated that this system will be capable of making 254 trillion operations for second (Vijayenthiran, 2021).  </p>

            <br>

            <h3> What is the likely impact?  </h3>
            <br>
            <p> One major impact that these more autonomous systems in our automotive vehicles is a more controlled and limited driving experience for everyone. Yes, there will be benefits such as a safer environment and less casualties on our roads, but I do feel like the experience of driving a vehicle and growing/improving driving skills will be taken away. Because more and more of the driving experience will be done for us, less and less will our input be required, thus making us lazier, less equipped and poorly prepared drivers. The main people affected by all this will be the next generation of drivers, the complete experience of learning to drive and how to park will be different. Instead of learning parking skills or how to perfectly control the vehicle they will more likely rely on these autonomous systems to do the work for them. In the future if cars do become more automated and require less driver input, jobs like driving instructors, businesses like driving schools and driving testers will become a thing of the past, because the driver will no longer require learning these skills. But also on the other hand, a more controlled and automated experience on the roads can be very beneficial. With less room for human error, or even just removing the ability of behaving recklessly on the road will reduce accidents, this will decrease the road tolls globally. In Australia from 2010-2020 an average of 1,000 people die on our roads each year, that is over 10,000 lives lost in the past decade alone (National Road Safety Strategy, 2021). With less accidents, this will allow the flow of traffic to not be disturbed and improve and reduce the time we spend traveling on our roads and reduce congestion in busy areas such as the CBD. If making our vehicles more autonomous means a safer and more efficient road experience for everyone then I do believe we are heading in the right direction.

            <h3> How will this affect you? </h3>
            <br>
            <p>I do feel with these advancements a part of my daily life that will be affected is my morning and afternoon commute to and from work. Currently the roads are overly congested and a single accident on even just one of the roads I take to get to work can more than double the time required for me to arrive. Due to this I usually must wake up much earlier to be able to leave my home at a minimum of one hour before I am required to be there, just to make sure I do not arrive late if there is an accident affecting the traffic on the way. If vehicles do become more autonomous and reduce the number of accidents on our roads, I will then have less of a hassle to make my way to work and returning home.  This means I will have more time to rest, and I will arrive at work with much more energy and better prepared. At my current employment I do have a co-worker who lives a distance of approximately 100kms from our workplace and due to this he must leave his home at 5:30am just to be able to make it on time to clock in at 7:30am. I know there are many others who love where they are employed and must travel a fair distant to keep their jobs. These advancements will both assist everyone in this situation to both arrive at work much quicker and safer as well, as they are in a higher risk of being in an accident due to their extensive time on the roads. Another great benefit will be an even safer road environment around school zones, this will keep our children and loved ones safer during drop off times and pickups.  As an autonomous car will stop reckless behaviour around our schools and reduce the danger our children can be in during these times.
