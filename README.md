<h3>Yes Chef</h3>
Yes Chef is a hospitality application currently under development by Technodrome Inc. Yes Chef’s primary goal is to consolidate all aspects of kitchen administration, allowing a chef or manager to easily monitor and control the business component (food costing, recipes, daily invoicing and wage control). The app will take information from the user in the form of goods, operating percentages, profits & expenses to allow a day-to-day feedback on where the business sits both financially and stock wise. The application will also delve into rostering, ordering.
<br>
<br>
In the manically busy world of hospitality the need for quick and easy behind the scenes operation is a must have for business, our team is determined to design and build an application that is easy to use, intuitive and provides up to date and relevant information for the user.
Based on the Philosophy of being user friendly Yes Chef! will be the go-to application for the Hospitality industry.
